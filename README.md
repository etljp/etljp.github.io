# Effort to Learn Japanese

Hey you found my place where I for once actually try to learn Japanese, from song lyrics.

[You can view available songs in this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JvjjKyKPOtX0siVqJ6a3726VL8yJRVQ11lvoFviOoWk/edit?usp=sharing)

### Contributing

If for what ever reason you want to contribute to this madness, copy the blank html and start from there.
Make sure to add furigana to **every** kanji, even simple N5 kanji like ä»Š should have furigana. 
Don't forget to add some kinda translation, hopefully you will highlight some words and actually try to understand the song.
